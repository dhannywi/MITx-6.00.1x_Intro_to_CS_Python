Exercise: iter power

Write an iterative function iterPower(base, exp) that calculates the exponential base**exp by simply using successive multiplication.
For example, iterPower(base, exp) should compute base**exp by multiplying base times itself exp times.
Write such a function below.

This function should take in two values - base can be a float or an integer; 
exp will be an integer â‰¥ 0. It should return one numerical value.
Your code must be iterative - use of the ** operator is not allowed.
"""

def iterPower(base, exp):
    '''
    base: int or float.
    exp: int >= 0
 
    returns: int or float, base^exp
    '''
    prod = 1
    for i in range(1, exp+1):
        prod *= base
    return prod
